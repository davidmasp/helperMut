## Overview

HyperMut provides basic functionalities and helper
functions to work with mutational and genomic data in R. It builds up
on pre-existing tools from bioc to set up a framework for analysis. 
I mostly use it for my work in cancer genomics but in principle any other
field working in mutations or population diversity could be used.


## Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
## If still private, make sure that there is a enviroment variable (.Renviron)
## with the token (PAT). The name of the variable should be GITHUB_PAT
remotes::install_github("davidmasp/helpermut@develop")

```

```{r coverage, eval = TRUE}

covr::package_coverage()

```


## Usage

### Simplify mutation codes

```{r}
mutations = c("TCA>T","TGA>A")
simplify_muts(mutations)
```

### Cosine similarities from PCAWG signatures

```{r}
# generate 3 random sigs
set.seed(42)
de_novo_sig = runif(n = 96*3,min = 0,max = 1)
de_novo_sig = matrix(de_novo_sig, ncol = 3)
rownames(de_novo_sig) = pos_ms96
colnames(de_novo_sig) = LETTERS[1:3]

cosmic_sigs = download_signature_set(type = "cosmic")

res = compare_signature_sets(x = de_novo_sig,y = cosmic_sigs)
heatmap(res)
```


### Colors and Plots

The standard colors used for mutational profiles in papers are available as 
a variable.

```{r}
tr_colors

tr_colors_ct = tr_colors
names(tr_colors_ct) = simplify_muts(names(tr_colors_ct),
                                    simplify_set = c("C","T"))

tr_colors_ct
```



## Other relevant packages

Some functionalities implemented in this packages are also available in other
packages from bioconductor. Hopefully, the current implementation in this
package will have an added value to the user. 

* [SomaticSignatures](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SomaticSignatures.html) It extracts Mutation Subtype information from VCFs (restricted to a defined ctx). It also performs NMF/PCA signature extraction which is not covered in helperMut.
* [MutationalPatterns](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MutationalPatterns.html) Same as somaticSignatures.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to the package, please fork the repo and submit
a PR. Currently the package is under development so no features are explicitily
requested.
