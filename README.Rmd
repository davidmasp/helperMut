## Overview

HyperMut provides basic functionalities and helper
functions to work with mutational and genomic data in R. It builds up
on pre-existing tools from bioc to set up a framework for analysis. 
I mostly use it for my work in cancer genomics but in principle any other
field working in mutations or population diversity could be used.
