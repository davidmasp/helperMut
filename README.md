## Overview

HyperMut provides basic functionalities and helper functions to work
with mutational and genomic data in R. It builds up on pre-existing
tools from bioc to set up a framework for analysis. I mostly use it for
my work in cancer genomics but in principle any other field working in
mutations or population diversity could be used.
